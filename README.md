## What is Bugcrowd University?
> Bugcrowd University is a free and open source project to help level-up our security researchers. It includes content modules to help our researchers find the most critical and prevalent bugs that impact our customers. Each module will have slide content, videos, and labs for researchers to master the art of bug hunting. As time goes on we hope the community will help us curate BCU and create a new standard for security testing training!

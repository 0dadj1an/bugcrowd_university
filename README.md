## What is Bugcrowd University?
Bugcrowd University is a free and open source project to help level-up our security researchers. It includes content modules to help our researchers find the most critical and prevalent bugs that impact our customers. Each module will have slide content, videos, and labs for researchers to master the art of bug hunting. As time goes on we hope the community will help us curate BCU and create a new standard for security testing training!

### Previous Work

Bugcrowd believes in empowering its crowd through education. Some portions of Bugcrowd University were inspired by the *How to Shot Web* DEF CON 23 talk and several iterations of *The Bug Hunter\'s Methodology* talks. Because these talks outgrew the standard conference slot, each topic is represented in Bugcrowd University here as an entire module. **Below are those past talks archived for your viewing should you want to add them to your education.** We have also added several other useful talks and presentations by Bugcrowd staff that we think highlights great learning opportunities for our researchers:

### Bugcrowd's LevelUp and LevelUp 0x02

Bugcrowd also has run several community-driven and researcher testing based conferences. These presentations are full of great educational content for a bug hunter. These are highly recommended supplemental materials:
